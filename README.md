# Physics Tome

## Motivation

A lot of the formulas have started piling up in the physics course and I wanted to have good reference to them without going back through my notebook. This endeavor also allowed me to create the functions in Python (which could very easily be written in another language) while still having the space to come back and draft the mathematical formulas in LaTeX's gnarly notation.

## Focus

Currently the focus is on Mechanical motion and related functions. Eventually, I hope I can return with more material should I enroll into a more phyiscs based program.
